`rustical` is a lightweight processor for vcalendar (.ical) files, written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/).

<!--
## Installing...
### ... via the latest release:
Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/cyberme0w/dmbm/releases) and download the executable for your operating system:

### ... manually:
Alternatively, or in case your OS is not already covered, you can easily build `rustical` yourself using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cyberme0w/rustical 

# Make sure to move into it
cd rustical

# Build using cargo
cargo build --release
```
This will generate the `target/release/rustical` executable file. Move it to somewhere in your `$PATH` (for instance: `$HOME/.local/bin/rustical` or `/usr/bin/rustical`) and we're done.
